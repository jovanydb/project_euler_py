# Project Euler – Python Solutions

A collection of my solutions to the problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).  
Some solutions are still work-in-progress as this is an ongoing project for me.  
All solutions here are implemented in **Python 3.13**.

## Purpose
- Practice algorithmic and mathematical problem-solving through Project Euler’s challenges.  
- Explore number theory, combinatorics, recursion, dynamic programming, and more.  
- Build a portfolio of clean, documented code to demonstrate logical thinking and computational skills.

## Repository Structure
Each problem is implemented in its own source file (e.g., `problem_1.ipynb`, `problem_2.ipynb`, etc.), with minimal boilerplate for clarity.  
Some problems may include helper modules for reusable mathematical operations.

## Usage
- Clone or download the repository:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jovanydb/project_euler_py.git
  cd project_euler_py
