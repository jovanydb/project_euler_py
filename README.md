# Project Euler – Python Solutions

A collection of my solutions to the problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
Some solutions are still work-in-progress as this is an ongoing project for me.
All solutions here are implemented in **Python 3.12**.

## Purpose  
- Practice algorithmic and mathematical problem-solving through Project Euler’s challenges.  
- Explore number theory, combinatorics, recursion, dynamic programming, and more.  
- Build a portfolio of clean, documented code to demonstrate logical thinking and computational skills.

## Usage  
- Download file, or just copy code into a python ide or notebook.
